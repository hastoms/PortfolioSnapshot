This app allows users to manually track their stock portfolio. Key points:

3. LOCAL DATA - All portfolio data (holdings, quantities, purchase prices) is stored locally on the device using SwiftData.

4. TO TEST THE APP:
   - Tap "+" to add a holding
   - Enter a stock symbol (e.g., AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT)
